This little Python utility calculates the LCA or [*lowest common ancestor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor) between two arbitrary points in a YAML string.

This is useful for modifying the selection in a file editor, so that the selection can be expanded to the smallest complete semantically meaningful part of a YAML string.


You may use this code *without* attribution, that is without mentioning where it's from or who wrote it. I would actually prefer if you didn't mention me.
You may even claim it's your own.
